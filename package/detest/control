Description: locale and ISO 2022 support for Unicode terminals
 Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
 UTF-8 terminal emulator.  It will convert application output  from  the
 locale's  encoding  into  UTF-8,  and convert terminal input from UTF-8
 into the locale's encoding.
 .
 This package installs an alternative binary "bluit", and
 adds it to the Debian alternatives via "xterm-filter".
 .
 This is version 2.0 of luit, which can use encoding information from
 either the font-encoding library, or the standard locale support in
 the C runtime library.
